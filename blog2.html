<p> I hate blogging, or at least the idea of it - I’ve never actually tried it, so what am I doing? For the same reason why I run exclusively on treadmills, I need a real an immediate threat of falling off the back if I don’t keep moving. <br>
<br>
I’ve been actively working towards my OVC application for 2 years, and although this is significantly less time then most people who have wanted to be a vet since about the age of 4, it’s been very difficult. I cannot emphasize strongly enough how much I recommend deciding to apply to professional school before your last year of undergrad.<br>
<br>
Between the slightly soul crushing experience of grad school (don’t worry it’s nothing spectacular about my experience just ask any grad student) along with the immobilizing fear that I could do everything (within reason) to achieve this goal but still may not success, has allowed me to lose a lot of that motivation to keep actively working towards my application. <br>
<br>
That’s where this blog comes in - everyday I need to do something that can count as an update to write about, or suffer the consequence of having to tell the whole internet (aka the maybe 4 people who will ever read this) that I was too lazy and/or scared to do something productive. Hopefully constructed social pressures will be a better motivator than my current plan of hoping I will just wakeup one day feeling incredibly motivated to do all the application related things I really don’t want to do. Especially like things asking people to do stuff that benefit me a lot and has no particular benefit to them - stay tuned for when this become a theme of sorts this fall where I will have to get a verifier for basically everything I have ever done. I’m really starting to realize how not fun this is going to be...<br>
<br>
However, I don’t only want this project will serve as a motivational tool. I’ve been really looking to find a creative project I can get excited about. For a long time I’ve wanted to learn how to make my own website from scratch and in the process become slightly better at coding. If things go as planned this blog will be the excuse to make a half functional website that I don’t hate. Perhaps if I get really fancy, I’ll even put other stuff up like pictures and a bit of an overview of the research I’m doing.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, the even more honest reason I’m doing this is to feel connected with the people I care about. Whether or not any of you read this, I’m writing you in mind. So here, take this gift that you didn’t ask for and enjoy? Sorry no refunds or exchange, all sales are final.<br>
<br>
Okay so that’s probably enough for the first go at it. The next couple of posts will probably be a bit more focused on background info about me and my plans, but eventually I’ll figure this out and actually write about getting into OVC - probably no more interesting but at least it's what has been promised. <br>
